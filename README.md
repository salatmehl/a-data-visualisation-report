# a-data-visualisation-report
This is a page I use to practice data visualisation, reporting, and stakeholder management using Looker Studio.

Hi again!

<b>Why this report is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had several modules on data analysis, visualisation and reporting. One of the final tasks was to analyse a given set of raw data collected in 3 months - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hO-dXvHDzJBPn4prA2zStzthM8tndRH5/view - by answering 7 business questions. The report aims to help a content manager in charge of the company's blog to analyse blog-related KPIs and improve the blog's performance based on those insights.
