# a-data-visualisation-report
This is a page I use to practice data visualisation, reporting, and stakeholder management.

Hi again!

<b>Why this report is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had one module on design principles and psychological concepts used in marketing. As an outcome, together with 2 colleagues, we created a comprehensive document that covers the main techniques and provides practical examples you might use in your own marketing strategies. From universal Gestalt principles to conversion-centred design, we covered it all so you can understand your customer better.
